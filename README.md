# Convex Hull Visualizer

## Opening the web app
Just open `Home.html`  in any web browser and enjoy.

## Adding points from file

The file should be in json format, containing an array of point objects with numerical attributes x and y.  `{'x': <Number>, 'y': <Number>}[]`

x and y should be between 100 and 600, with distance of at least 10 between two point centers. (The algorithm will still run if the conditions are not met, but the visualization may be difficult to interpret)
